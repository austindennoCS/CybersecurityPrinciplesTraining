<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<b>This guide covers five basic cybersecurity principles that every team member can start implementing today. These principles help keep our organization's information and systems safe from cyber threats.</b>
<h2 id="using-strong-passwords">Using Strong Passwords</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Using Strong Passwords:</b> Always create strong passwords that are hard to guess. Use a mix of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easy-to-guess passwords like "password123". Change your passwords regularly and do not reuse passwords across different sites.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="being-careful-with-emails">Being Careful with Emails</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Being Careful with Emails:</b> Be cautious when opening emails from unknown senders. Do not click on links or download attachments from suspicious emails as they might contain malware. Verify the sender's email address and be on the lookout for phishing attempts that try to trick you into providing personal information.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keeping-software-up-to-date">Keeping Software Up to Date</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Keeping Software Up to Date:</b> Regularly update all software, including your operating system, antivirus programs, and applications, to fix security holes. Turn on automatic updates if available to ensure you always have the latest security patches installed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-two-factor-authentication">Using Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Using Two-Factor Authentication:</b> Add an extra step to logging in, such as a code sent to your phone or an authentication app. This makes it harder for someone to access our systems even if they know your password. Enable two-factor authentication on all important accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="being-cautious-with-links-and-downloads">Being Cautious with Links and Downloads</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Being Cautious with Links and Downloads:</b> Only click on links and download files from trusted sources. Malicious links and downloads can install malware on your device. Always verify the source before downloading any software or clicking on links, especially from unsolicited emails.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<b>By implementing these five basic cybersecurity principles—using strong passwords, being careful with emails, keeping software up to date, using two-factor authentication, and being cautious with links and downloads—you can greatly enhance the security of our organization. These simple steps are easy to follow and can significantly reduce the risk of cyber threats.</b>
